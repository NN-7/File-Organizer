# File-Organizer
 An automatic file organizer

An automatic file organizer.  Will automatically sort files into directories and make new directories if needed, based on the file's name.

For example, a file called 'dir1_dir2_dir3~myfile.txt' will be stored in a folder called dir3, which is inside a folder called dir2, which is inside a folder called dir1. All you need to do is name the file, and then put it into the 'organizer' folder! You also need not run the program every time you want it to sort, as has an infinite loop to check for new files and store them away, checking every 10 seconds by default.
You can also leave the program running in the background.

Sadly you'll have to make the 'organizer' folder yourself because github is unable to copy the folder that I made.
